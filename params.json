Cataclysms happen, we revert to a state of disconnected pockets of survivors as we are no longer masters of nature. Though disconnected and temporarily offline, old instincts kick in and we crawl back to civilization while climate changes. The setting is somewhere between 5000 and 10000 AD, no-one is quite sure.\r\n\r\nA brief history\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThe next decades. Scientific and technological innovations create an abundance that spreads quickly. Capitalism provides material comfort for a global community. Conflicts decline. While the rich get richer, the middle class expands rapidly to consume most of the population. The 99% forget the abject poor, who die. Revolution never comes.\r\n\r\nFor a brief moment in our species history 10 billion individuals are mostly secure, well-nourished and healthy.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, civilization continues to consume non-renewable resources until they are completely gone or no longer are accessible in any practical way. Innovation and environmental efforts postpone, but do not prevent the inevitable depletion. \r\n\r\nEven the most ambitious carbon emission programs do little to stall the effects. While use of petrochemicals decline, the shift from fossil to renewable energy takes too long. Even with other energy sources, synthetic materials are still in high enough demand to keep production and exploration going. Coal usage declines at first, then increases again as gas runs out. Brown coal becomes the last cheap way to store and transport energy.\r\n\r\nAs this is happening, further advances in leisures of life nudges us into post-scarcity. Smart machines do all menial work. There is a surge of art and creativity. Science still progresses, but the exponential growth seen in the 21st century slows. Inventions dreamt of remain dreams. Fusion remains 30 years away.\r\n\r\nMoore's law glides to a halt. We never invent true AI. We never colonize spaaaaaace. A few attempts are made at commericalizing it, but the investments invariably fail. We do not cure aging and the singularity never comes. \r\n\r\nAfter some time, humanity settles into a steady-state of being really well off. Culture changes. Lack of external stress eliminates incentives for individuals to take on skills and knowledge.\r\n\r\nPopulation, which growth has been close to zero ever since the poorest person was better off than a citizen of Western Europe was in the late 1990s, ... workforce ... food supply ... potassium and phosphorous ... \r\n\r\n... conflicts increase ... decline ... \r\n\r\n... climate change ... resource wars ...\r\n\r\n... last antibiotics fail ... \r\n\r\nThe entire carbon sink of oil, gas and coal is spent, most of it released into the atmosphere. It does not matter whether it takes 100 or 1000 years. On a geological timescale the change is instantaneous. \r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhile the writing is on the wall, even the most farsighted person can only see so far into the future. While our grandchildren are people we hopefully do or shall know, already their grandchildren are strangers. How then, can we expect us to plan for millenia?\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
