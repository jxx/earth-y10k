A brief history of the future
=============================

The next decades. Scientific and technological innovations create an abundance that spreads quickly. Capitalism provides material comfort for a global community. Conflicts decline. While the rich get richer, the middle class expands rapidly to consume most of the population. The 99% forget the abject poor, who die. Revolution never comes.

For a brief moment in our species history 10 billion individuals are mostly secure, well-nourished and healthy.

To achieve this, civilization continues to consume non-renewable resources until they are completely gone or no longer are accessible in any practical way. Innovation and environmental efforts postpone, but do not prevent the inevitable depletion. 

Even the most ambitious carbon emission programs do little to stall the effects. While use of petrochemicals decline, the shift from fossil to renewable energy takes too long. Even with other energy sources, synthetic materials are still in high enough demand to keep production and exploration going. Coal usage declines at first, then increases again as gas runs out. Brown coal becomes the last cheap way to store and transport energy.

As this is happening, further advances in leisures of life nudges us into post-scarcity. Smart machines do all menial work. There is a surge of art and creativity. Science still progresses, but the exponential growth seen in the 21st century slows. Inventions dreamt of remain dreams. Fusion remains 30 years away. But boy, we have apps and robots for everything.

Moore's law glides to a halt. We never invent true AI. We never colonize space. A few attempts are made at commericalizing it, but the investments invariably fail. We do not cure aging and the singularity never comes.

Humanity settles into a steady-state of being really well off. *The High*. Culture changes. Lack of external stress reduce incentives for individuals to take on skills and knowledge. We grow more hedonistic. Masters of the universe, fusion or not. Life expectancy is a hundred plus, but long term problems are still ignored as generations forget. One measurable factor is population creep. Automation makes childbearing and -raising easier. Global infant mortaility is zero As more time can be devoted to raising children, population growth rate slowly increases. A few attempts at child-restriction policies are ignored and denounced as fascist, as overpopulation and food shortage is a concept of the past. The world can easiily feed 30 billion. And for a time it does. Even the age of oil ends without causing too much trouble, what can not be powered by batteries runs on biofuels that consume half the world farmlands.

Until the potassium and phosphorous futures goes ballistic as all of this year's expolartory missions for new deposits report negs. Two pieces of the periodic table are no longer available in the enormous quantities the world demands. No matter of technology can provide the basic need of any large scale agriculture when the Earth has run out of elements.

For centuries, the poorest person has been better off than a millionaire in the 1990s. Basic income covering expenses for most, paid work perplexingly a thing only for idealists. Now food and transportation costs are rising to the extent that *binkers* have to start budgeting. While food shortage is still a few decades off, this event is only the first of many small and large events that send humanity on a long path back to the [state of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_nature).

... conflicts increase ... decline spirals ... climate change worst case ... resource wars ... last antibiotics fail ... details scarce and timeline nonexistent ...

The entire carbon sink of oil, gas and coal is spent, most of it released into the atmosphere. It does not matter whether it takes 100 or 1000 years. On a geological timescale the change is instantaneous.

While the writing is on the wall, even the most farsighted person can only see so far into the future. While our grandchildren are people we hopefully do or shall know, already their grandchildren are strangers. How then, can we expect us to plan for millenia?
