#### Notes on names and words

During The High, a creole evolved from the world's major languages. Based on English, it had substantial vocabulary from particularly Mandarin, Spanish, Russian and Norwegian (from the geopolitical shift towards the north during the late 21st century) and substantial regional variations. *Intlish* in its various dialects was so useful for international discourse that it out-competed all local languages, which died out over a century or two. 

The pace of cultural change and exchange outpaced attempts at standardising written Intlish, providing archeo-librarians with ample headaches when deciphering texts from before the Blackout. 

In the year X000, spoken languages are again varied beyond comprehension. Intlish survives through ancient texts, and scrapes by as a limited vocabulary pidgin amongst traders (who often trade in documents, *d√•x*), as well as in place names and expresions with ancient origins.
