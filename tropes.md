##### Story hooks and tropes

* New History (NH). Northern Standard calendar year 580. Tartica calendars vary between nations, the longest count 1211 years since the Merikans first arrived. Not that calendars really matter. 

4 civs / worlds:
* Northern hemisphere remains of modern world as we know it. Went through the blackout, but some places have been inhabited continously.
* (An)Tarctica. Settled by disparate groups during the blackout and rise. Civilization rebuildt with limited knowledge of the Ancient world.
* Merkans, heat-adapted subspecies of *Homo Sapiens* of unknown origins. Runs the only communicaiton trail between north and south.
* Elonites. Unknown to the rest.

Stories / epics
* Zheng He expedition from north to south - or the other way. Invasion force?
* A field zoological expedition researching donkey-sized ducks in Fugo when merkians arrive for the first time in decades. They bear dox and news of the coming expedition.

Travel:
* Sail ships with emergency steam (charcoal/wood)
* Overland thousand year old route across the Americas, only passable by merkans.
* Svalbar has recently bred grains that allow for limited industrial production of biodiesel. This means partially motorized transportation, and opens for a sea expedition to Tartica, the first in NH. But which route to take?

Factions:
* Norpol. Centre of humanity 2.0 according to themselves. Ayn Rand meets Kowloon walled megacity. Free economic zone. Most live cramped, poor, nasty, brutish, and short lives.
* Redwood nation, North Am. Got trees.
* Svalbar. Got seeds and secret knowledge.
* Merkans. Control very high value north-south trade and communications.
* Sulfur miners and guano gatherers. Got gunpowder.
* The Tartican freelance navy. Needs coal and gunpowder. Got firepower, supplies protection.
* An insular doxarchy claiming the year is not more than AD 2114.

Resources/tech:
* Trade in knowledge hugely important. Wars are fought over dox. Cryptography and proof of work computation are highly sought skills.
* Antarctica has coal. Valuable. 
* Electricity is used but no standards exist. Detailed knowledge is scarce.  Local production only. Batteries transported and sold in some places.
* [Tartica] Tronicians dabble in electronics like it was magic.
* [North] Electronics more developed, doing library-archeology on Ancient Data.

Characters:
* Acolyte at Svalbar institute.
* Group of Merikans in Antarctica. Suspicious of the new traders and their news.
 

Locations:
* Rushmor and caves nearby. Merkian holy land.
