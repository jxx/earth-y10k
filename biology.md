The rapid change in climate lasting a few millenia drove most of the species known in the Ancient World to extinction. Confirming that Gould also was right, this punctuated equilibrium caused some lucky-fit species to evolve over just a few hundred generations to fill holes in the ecosystem.

Antarctica saw a gradual migration of species previously found in South America, southern Africa and Australasia.

####Extinct and extant species
All wild land mammals except [rodents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent) are extinct. 

Proving that the best survival trait to possess for an animal is usefullness to humans, some domesticated mammals have survived:
* Donkeys and horses. Horses have decreased in size and are no larger than donkeys.
* Dogs. Still man's best friend, still bred in various sizes and shapes. Kennels select for useful traits only; having a dog as a pure pet would be regarded as insane.
* A relative of the housecat, still called *cat*, is the only feline to survive: a crossbred species of about cheetah size. Feral populations exist.

Rodents have won the competition on land. The warmer parts of the globe is generally populated by small rats and mice. Tartica has herds of giant [capybaras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara) that are the largest extant land animals by weight.

All whales and fish are gone. Squid and octopuses are the only large ocean animals.

The biggest winner of all are birds. Being able to migrate, intelligence, and large variations in size and ecological function has seen some populations going through bottlenecks and come out on the other side as highly evolved species. Tool use incidence is up among corvidae, with some giant raven populations rumored to show signs of trading. Peregrine falcons now hunt in packs of a few dozen, dominating the food pyramid and deadly to unarmed humans.
