The rapid change in climate lasting a few millenia drove most of the species known in the Ancient World to extinction. Confirming that Gould also was right, this punctuated equilibrium caused some lucky-fit species to evolve over just a few hundred generations to fill holes in the ecosystem.

Antarctica saw a gradual migration of species previously found in South America, southern Africa and Australasia.

####Extinct and extant species
All wild land mammals except [rodents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent) are extinct. 

Proving that the best survival trait to possess for an animal is usefullness to humans, some domesticated mammals have survived:
* Donkeys.
* Dogs. Still man's best friend, still bred in various sizes and shapes. Kennels select for useful traits only; having a dog as a pure pet would be regarded as insane.
* A relative of the housecat, still called "cat", is the only feline to survive: a crossbred species of about cheetah size. Feral populations exist.

Rodents have won the competition on land. The warmer parts of the globe is generally swarming in small rats and mice. Tartica has herds of giant [capybaras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara) that are the largest extant land animals by weight.

All whales and fish are gone. Squid and octopuses are the only large ocean animals. Most of the oceans in the hot zone is a soup of kelp, algae and jellyfish.

The biggest winner are birds. Being able to migrate, high intelligence, and large variations in size and ecological function has seen some populations go through bottlenecks and come out on the other side as highly evolved species. The rodent food source has also helped.
* Tool use incidence is up among corvidae, with some rumors of giant ravens trading and using fire.
* Peregrine falcons cooperate and hunt in family packs of a few dozen, dominating the food chain and deadly to unarmed humans.
* Emperor Penguins have less fat and take on giant squids with newfound aggression, on the path to becoming the new sharks. These sharks walk on land.

####Flora

[Ferns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyathea_medullaris) have made a comeback.
