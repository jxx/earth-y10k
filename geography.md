#### The world as we know it

Humanity is relegated to the far north and south. In the northern hemisphere, the descendants of The High live in the nothern parts of North America and Eurasia. Some groups migrated south after the Rise collapse of the ice sheet and established 

Nothing but rumors exist of any other population pockets, but there very well could be. With a few exceptions, not much is known about the world south of 60 degrees north, or north of the tip of south America. where the uninhabitable jungles and deserts of the high tropics begin.

The increased temperature has drastically increased atmospheric convection, leading to a year-round hypercane season in both the Atlantic and Pacific. While some brave souls attempt from time to time, no-one has sailed south of the equator in currently recorded history.

* Norpol: Ancient structure still standing. A Manhattan-sized, man made platform on concrete pillars driven kilometers into the ocean floor. Delerict for millenia, no trace of the original building structures remain. But due to its location, the island has been inhabited and the nexus for civilization since the time gap and beyond. No central authority, it is considered neutral and peaceful ground for trades and talks.
* Svalbar: The ancient Svalbard Seed Vault was rediscovered 200 years ago by a lichen farmer tending his fields, containing thousands of crumbling specimen containers and a partially preserved library of general knowledge printed on an unknown plastic-type paper. This spurred the creation of the Svalbar Society which quickly grew into one of the most powerful institutions in the world; part university-monestary, part merchant republic, full time slavers.
* Rushmor: Beneath five ancient faces carved into granite lies the capital of the little and southermost known state of Merika. Fierce and deeply religious, they are rumored to control great ancient treasures.

While there are no records of humans settling permanently on Antarctica during The High, most available resources were extracted as the ice sheet retracted. A few scattered coal deposits are all that remains of fossil fuels on the entire planet.
